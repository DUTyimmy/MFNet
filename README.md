## Prerequisites
### environment
  - Windows 10
  - Torch 1.8.1
  - CUDA 10.0
  - Python 3.7.4
  - other environment requirment can be found in requirments.txt 

### training data

## Training
### 1st training stage
Case1: Please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/DUTyimmy/generatePGT).

Case2: We also upload ready-made pseudo labels in **Training data** (the link above), you can directly use our offered two kinds of pseudo labels for convenience. CAMs are also presented if you needed.

### 2nd training stage

#### 1, setting the training data to the proper root as follows:

```
MF_code -- data -- DUTS-Train -- image -- 10553 samples

                -- ECSSD (not necessary) 
                
                -- pseudo labels -- label0_0 -- 10553 pseudo labels
                
                                 -- label1_0 -- 10553 pseudo labels
```
#### 2, training
```Run main.py```

Here you can set ECCSD dataset as validation set for optimal results by setting ```--val``` to ```True```, of course it is not necessary in our work.

## Testing
```Run test_code.py```

You need to configure your desired testset in ```--test_root```.  Here you can also perform PAMR and CRF on saliency maps for a furthur refinements if you want, by setting ```--pamr``` and ```--crf``` to True. **Noting** that the results in our paper do not adopt these post-process for a fair comparison.

The evaluation code can be found in [here](https://github.com/jiwei0921/Saliency-Evaluation-Toolbox).

## Saliency maps & Checkpoint
We offer our saliency maps and checkpoints on various backbones (including DenseNet-169, ResNet-101, ResNet-50 and VGG-16) for more convenient comparison in the future. The results in our paper are all come from the model based on DenseNet-169, and we also highly recommend the following researchers adopt same backbone for a more fair and convenient comparison.
